# Introduction with emphasis and note
st.write("""
Welcome to the **Gap Project**! In this project, we're diving into a key question:

### Is there a gap in the performance of marketing campaigns in the Transportation and Robotics industries when the campaigns only use videos as marketing content?

**Note:** For privacy reasons, we've changed the names of the industries, values and other sensitive information in this project. However, the methodology and the data proportions remains the same, and our goal is to showcase the analysis structure and approach.

1. **Client Satisfaction Comparison:** We'll compare client satisfaction levels between transportation and robotics campaigns.
2. **Performance Influences:** We'll explore whether industry-specific characteristics significantly influence campaign performance.

Note that in the full project, we also conducted thorough data exploration, univariate and multivariate analyses, and addressed outliers among other steps. However, to keep things clear and focused in this demo, we're showcasing these two key analyses.
