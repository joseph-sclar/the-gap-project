st.markdown("so, is there a gap in the performance of marketing campaigns in the Transportation and Robotics industries when the campaigns only use videos as marketing content?")
st.markdown("""
1. **There is a gap!**
We found that Robotics and Transportation marketing campaigns don't perform the same way. There's a noticeable difference in their outcomes, showing one might be more effective than the other.

2. **Is it because of the industries?**
While it's easy to think the gap in performance is just because Robotics and Transportation are different kinds of industries, our analysis suggests there's more to it. The differences between these sectors alone don't fully account for the variance in campaign effectiveness.

3. **Enough Data?**
Despite noticing these trends, we currently don't have enough data to pinpoint exactly why this performance gap exists.

st.markdown("""
1. **Transportation generates more revenue**: Order Value (AOV) is significantly higher for Transportation, showing that each conversion is potentially more valuable.
2. **Transportation campaigns are more costly**: However, Transportation campaigns are more expensive across Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Order (CPO), and Cost Per Visit (CPV).
3. **Transportation campaigns have less engagement**: Robotics ads have a higher Click-Through Rate (CTR), meaning they are better at getting people to click.

**Path Forward**

Transportation campaigns have room for growth in efficiency and ROI. There is a clear performance gap between Transportation and Robotics marketing campaigns, not entirely explained by industry differences. This suggests potential for improving Transportation campaign performance.
